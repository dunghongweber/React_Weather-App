#Problems:
Users provide a valid city name to get the weather information.
Provide nice UI using Bootstrap.

#What I learned:
Utilizing a free weather API from RapidAPI for weather information.
All the web elements are styled by CSS and Bootstrap to provide better UI.

#Reflex:
this project helps me to practice my skill with bootstrap and learn to interact with 3rd party API using javascript.
